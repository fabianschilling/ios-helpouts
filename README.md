A little side project that I was working on for a couple of weeks. I abandoned it because [peerby](https://www.peerby.com/) essentially did what I intended to. My goal was to provide a local exchange platform for general help from people in your vicinity, not only for borrowing things from neighbors. Oh well, it was still lots of fun.

The project **does not compile** since most of the dependencies are not in place or deprecated. The only thing I did after I dug it up was to let the [Swift Migrator](https://swift.org/migration-guide/) tool work its magic. Use at your own risk.
